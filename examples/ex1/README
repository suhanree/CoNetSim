In this example, there are two networks, one fixed (long-range) and the other varying (short-range). Nodes have periodic or linear node states, and moves randomly on 2D periodic lattice.
Three papers are written using this example.
(1) Phys. Rev. E, 83, 056110 (2011). (Only one network with short-range links exists. The other network has zero link.)
(2) arXiv:1109.0556 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0556) (2011). (A network with short-range links, and a network with long-range links exist. A network with long-range links is not varying.)
(3) arXiv:1109.0556 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0556) (2012). (A network with short-range links, and a network with long-range links exist. A network with long-range links is not varying.)

How to use the code.
1, If it hasn't been done, compile the library first at the directory $CONET, assuming $CONET is the root directory for the library. The library 'libconet.a' will be created at '$CONET/lib'

2, To compile this example: run 'make' from this directory ($CONET/examples/ex1). Then, the executable file, 'Ex1' will be created at '$CONET/bin'

3, To run: change the current directory to '$CONET/run', and run '$CONET/bin/Ex1 param_Ex1.in' where 'param_Ex1.in' is an input file that gives all the parameters for this example. Parameters are explained in the input file.
